Agora is a web service platform solely for students/graduates to buy, sell and trade
second-hand items. We find that current trading services are exploited due to poor 
mechanics and restrictions - more specifically, it is spammed with retail businesses
that post repetitive listings. This is where they have lost the meaning of being a "second-hand"
trading service, and instead a platform for retail businesses to market themselves.

Agora aims to bring back the value of trading by targeting an audience that needs it
the most - students. They can only create an account by using their University ID, which
filters out all the unecessary retailers that we don't want. This is the core
differentiating factor Agora seeks to provide to customers, with a strict focus on 
delivering the best user experience.
